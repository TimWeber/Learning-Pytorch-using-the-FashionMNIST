# To better learn the basics of PyTorch, TorchVisioin and deep learning, I wrote a basic deep learning algorithm to try classify items of clothing.

While more needs to be done, such as explore other optimisers, such as Adam, and activation functions such as ReLu. I feel that this has been a good introduction to PyTorch, especially having come from MATLAB.

I will be updating this README to better document my learning process shortly.
